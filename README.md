# eid-mw-sdk-delphi

## Overview

eid-mw-sdk-delphi is a translation of C code from 
https://github.com/Fedict/eid-mw/tree/master/doc/sdk/examples/C
to Delphi.

Initially, the main goal was to make the Delphi code as close as possible to
the original C code of Fedict.

Now, the goal is rather to make the Delphi code as close as possible
to https://github.com/linuxunderground/eid-mw-sdk-c, which is also a fork of
the original C code of Fedict.

It should work with all versions of Delphi and even with 
Lazarus/FreePascal.

Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.

## Indy

Required Indy files are embedded with eid-mw-sdk-delphi project.
However, to run some .exe files, you need libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll.
Copy/paste these 2 files in the same directory as your eid-mw-sdk-delphi .exe
files.

These 2 dll are available at https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/


## Third-party files

The 2 files below have been released by delphi-jedi.org under Mozilla Public

### PKCS11T.pas

### wcrypt2.pas

You may retrieve the original version of this file at
[delphi-jedi.org](https://sourceforge.net/p/projectjedi/website/HEAD/tree/trunk/delphi-jedi.org/www/files/api/CryptoAPI2.zip?format=raw)

However, I improved wcrypt2.pas by adding
* CertGetNameStringW function required by cert_registration.pas unit.
* SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 capabilities.

Generally speaking, waiting a more official repository, the latest version
of wcrypt2.pas is in this github repository.
